# Import necessary libraries
# (You'll need OpenCV, NumPy, and potentially scikit-learn)

# 1. Image Acquisition and Preprocessing
def acquire_image():

# Code to capture image from camera or load from file
# Return the image

def preprocess_image(image):

# Resize image if necessary
# Convert to grayscale
# Apply any necessary filters (e.g., noise reduction)
# Return preprocessed image

# 2. Face Detection
def detect_faces(image):

# Load pre-trained face detection model (e.g., Haar Cascade)
# Apply the face detection algorithm
# Return list of detected face regions

# 3. Feature Extraction
def extract_features(face_image):

# Implement or use a pre-trained feature extractor
# (e.g., HOG, SIFT, or deep learning-based method)
# Return feature vector

# 4. Face Recognition
def train_recognition_model(training_data, labels):

# Choose and train a classification model
# (e.g., SVM, k-NN, or a simple neural network)
# Return trained model

def recognize_face(feature_vector, model):

# Use the trained model to classify the face
# Return predicted label and confidence score

# 5. Displaying Results
def draw_results(image, faces, labels):

# Draw bounding boxes around detected faces
# Label each face with recognized name or "Unknown"
# Display or save the resulting image

# Main execution flow
def main():
    # Load or capture image
    image = acquire_image()

    # Preprocess the image
    processed_image = preprocess_image(image)

    # Detect faces
    faces = detect_faces(processed_image)

    # For each detected face
    for face in faces:
        # Extract features
        features = extract_features(face)

        # Recognize face
        label, confidence = recognize_face(features, trained_model)

        # Store results for display

    # Display or save results
    draw_results(image, faces, labels)


# Run the main function
