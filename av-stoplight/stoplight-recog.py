# Traffic Sign Recognition System

# 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
def load_dataset():
    # Load a traffic sign dataset (e.g., German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)
    # Split into training, validation, and test sets
    return train_data, val_data, test_data


def preprocess_images(data):
    # Resize images to a consistent size
    # Normalize pixel values
    # Augment training data (optional: rotation, scaling, brightness adjustment)
    return processed_data


# 2. Feature Extraction
def extract_features(images):
    # Options:
    # a) Traditional: HOG, SIFT, or color histograms
    # b) Deep learning: Use pre-trained CNN as feature extractor
    return features


# 3. Model Development
def create_model():
    # Options:
    # a) Traditional ML: SVM, Random Forest
    # b) Deep learning: Custom CNN or fine-tuned pre-trained model
    return model


def train_model(model, train_data, val_data):
    # Train the model on the training data
    # Use validation data to prevent overfitting
    # Implement early stopping and learning rate scheduling
    return trained_model


# 4. Evaluation
def evaluate_model(model, test_data):
    # Assess model performance on test set
    # Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
    # Generate confusion matrix
    return metrics


# 5. Real-time Detection
def detect_signs_in_video():
    # Capture video stream (simulating a car camera)
    # For each frame:
    #   - Preprocess the frame
    #   - Detect regions of interest (potential signs)
    #   - For each ROI:
    #     - Extract features
    #     - Classify using the trained model
    #   - Display results on the frame
    pass


# 6. Performance Optimization
def optimize_for_speed():
    # Implement techniques to improve inference speed:
    # - Model quantization
    # - Hardware acceleration (e.g., OpenCV DNN module, TensorRT)
    # - Efficient frame skipping
    pass


# Main execution
def main():
    # Load and preprocess data
    train_data, val_data, test_data = load_dataset()
    processed_train = preprocess_images(train_data)
    processed_val = preprocess_images(val_data)
    processed_test = preprocess_images(test_data)

    # Create and train model
    model = create_model()
    trained_model = train_model(model, processed_train, processed_val)

    # Evaluate model
    metrics = evaluate_model(trained_model, processed_test)
    print(metrics)

    # Run real-time detection
